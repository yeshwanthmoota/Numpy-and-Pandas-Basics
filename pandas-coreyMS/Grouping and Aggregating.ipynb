    "    2. The values at these indices are 4 and 5.\n",
    "    3. Calculate the average: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5.\n",
    "So, the median of the given data set is 4.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of data points is odd, you simply need to find the middle value, i.e. (n+1)/2 'th value directly without averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And the mean of the data 5, 2, 7, 1, 1000, 3, 6, 4 is (5 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 1000 + 3 + 6 + 4)/8 = 128.5\n",
